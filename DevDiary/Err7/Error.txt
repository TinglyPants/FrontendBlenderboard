For some reason, my post creation data context is not being updated when i think it should be.

Figure1 = code (post creation tool)
Figure2 = console logs

solution attempt one: using the functional form of useState updates
using a function will queue the useState updates so that sequential operations happen in proper order

Figure3 = code after
Figure4 = results

This didnt work.

Solution attempt two: changing the order of operations
Figure5 = code after
Figure6 = results -> success!
