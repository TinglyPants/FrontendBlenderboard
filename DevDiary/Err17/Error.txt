I need to do some more reading into .stl, .obj, .fbx, .glb, .gltf and .dae files.

It has come to my attention that these files all store varying levels of information
about a scene, therefore the backend and frontend need to accommodate these differences.
I also don't know enough about each one to do this, so I shall find out now.
