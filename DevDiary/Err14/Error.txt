Problem: How do i reliably use and store JWT tokens for auth?
Well, I want to do it manually. Ill use a context provider to make the auth data available throughout the whole app.
In terms of actual storage, I have three options: Cookies, local storage and session storage. Cookies would make
sense, but since my frontend application contacts a remote API on a different server I cannot use cookies here.
Session storage is similar to local storage, except it is wiped whenever the tab is closed. This is not the desired behaviour.
Therefore, I will use local storage. Local storage is stored until either the user clears it or my code does. perfect.
I will manually attach the auth data to requests that need it. 

Auth tokens will be stored once they are received from the server and retrieved from local storage when needed. If needed, they
will be sent in requests. Thats the plan!

This is less of an error and more of a plan, but i think it is useful to log this down!
