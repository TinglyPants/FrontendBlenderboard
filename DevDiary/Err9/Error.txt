Problem: How do I make an API call as soon as the home page loads?
Solution: useEffect

Figure1 = code
Figure2 = console

Whats going on here? Well, useEffect is a strictly synchronous hook. This prevents potential race conditions, where multiple useEffect hooks cold conflict on the same page.
to handle this, I will get useEffect to call a single async IIFE (immediately invoked function expression) that will handle everything else from there. This prevents race 
conditions and is non-blocking too.

Figure3 = code after
Figure4 = console after

This works nicely, but how do we then get this to instantiate post components on screen?
useState is the tool for this job!
I will initialise an empty array as a state hook, then once the API responds i will update that state. 
This will trigger a page re-render with the new data.

(I also made another post to illustrate better)

Figure5 = code
Figure6 = page

Boom! that was actually very easy but illustrates the fundamentals of react nicely.
Now i must create the post components to handle it from there.
