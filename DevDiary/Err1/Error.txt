Logo in navbar is not centered properly.
Figure1 = code
Figure2 = site (diagnostic tools enabled)

Solution: use flexbox
Figure3 = code afterwards
Figure4 = site afterwards

This has centered it somewhat, but its too close to the left.

Solution: Margins
Figure5 = code afterwards
Figure6 = site afterwards

Perfect!
