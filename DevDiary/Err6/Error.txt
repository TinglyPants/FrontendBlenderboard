The problem here is that I have no way of changing the Post Creation data from within my post creation tool. I also in the future
want this data to be accessible from a post preview component, which is a sibling of the Post Creation Tool component. This is not
a huge issue, as I could simply declare the state in the parent component (the post creation page) and pass it down through props.
The problem comes when I want to use that state from within a child of the post preview component for example. I could still pass 
the state down as another prop, but this could become ugly and hard to manage.

                    PostCreationPage                                      parent
                  /                  \
PostCreationTool                      PostPreviewComponent                child
                                      /               \
                            PostPreviewImage        PostPreviewTitle      grandchild etc...


A more elegant way to handle this is the context API. This works with state to enable children at any depth to access the same state without
falling victim to what is known as 'prop drilling'.

Figure1 = PostCreation page before
Figure2 = PostCreation page after
Figure3 = PostCreationTool code after
