I cannot easily change the size of my SVG icons.
Figure1 = SVG code

Solution: props
Figure2 = code after

Interesting note: I cannot do `w-${size} h-${size}` because of how tailwind preprocesses the classes for optimising. 
I must explicitly state "w-8 h-8" somewhere in my code for it to include that class for example, so this is the best way to handle that.
This isnt entirely clear so I have included a comment.
