Again not really an error, but we need video support in the media viewer.

Step1: separate mediaIds into video and images

Figure1 = code
Done. Everything still works, i think.

Problem: video is not being rendered or anything yet.
Solution: add video tags n stuff

Figure2 = site
Figure3 = code after

That was.... surprisingly easy?
