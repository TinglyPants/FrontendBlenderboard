Problem: The media viewer component is huge!

Figure1 = site
Figure2 = code (ignore error thats an eslint thing)

Solution: place it in a div.
This kinda worked

Figure3 = site now
Figure4 = code

Problem is, the image is overflowing.
Solution: css

Figure5 = site now
Figure6 = code

Wonderful! How on earth do I get this to work with multiple images?
Well, ill instantiate all of the images I need first, then translate them with CSS to show them!

Figure7 = site super zoomed out
Figure8 = code stripped down of css

Now to add CSS until it looks good!
Figure9 = site
Figure10 = code

As you can see on line 9, I have used a style attribute rather than tailwind. This is because tailwind uses a preprocessor to handle classes,
therefore cannot effectively be used for more dynamic css. This is an easy thing to work around though.

Problem: cannot cycle through images. Solution: useState hooks

Figure11 = site
Figure12 = code

Almost done, I just need to be able to choose to go forwards or backwards.
Im going to have some absolutely positioned divs with SVGs of arrows that only appear when you hover. Sounds easy enough, right?

Figure13 = site
Figure14 = code

That was not bad at all, thanks tailwindcss!

One last thing: If the media only has one image, we dont need any buttons to appear. To fix that, Ill use the short circuit operator!

Figure15 = code (notice use of fragments)
