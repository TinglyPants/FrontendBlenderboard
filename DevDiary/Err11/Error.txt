Scroll behaviour is not going as expected.

Figure1 = App.js code
Figure2 = Home.js code

I have way too many 'container' components to manage, all with different backgrounds. For testing, im gonna strip them down as much as possible
Figure3 = changing colours to make it all clearer
Figure4 = everything back to basics (it looks awful)

Idea designed in paint: Figure5 (Arrows indicate flex direction)

Figure6 = after redone

After putting that into action, it seems to have partially worked!
Still some weird bits, so lets fix that. 

Firstly is the horizontal scrolling being weird. I believe this is caused by the vertical scrollbar getting in the way.
