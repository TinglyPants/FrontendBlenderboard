Not really an error, but I need some plans and goals.

Plan:
Get the 3d scene renderer to work, with model viewing, options for lighting and various helpers like axes and UV textures - also need to texture the model (PBR?)!
Get the 3d scene renderer to appear when needed with the post viewing page
get the post viewing page up and running
Most important of all, the scene renderer needs to be flexible and have lots of options! I need to re-do the post creation page to accommodate this
I need options for pbr, non-pbr, different textures, filetypes etc. Also need example renders of stuff!
Ill need a context provider for the whole thing... thats a pain.

This was a fun brainstorm.
