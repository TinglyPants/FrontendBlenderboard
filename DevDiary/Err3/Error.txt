I cannot set the sidebar height to fill the remaining viewport space without overflowing.
Figure1 = code in SideBar.js
Figure2 = code in App.js
Figure3 = site (test colours used) - notice the scrollbar.

Solution attempt 1: make the entire wrapping div flex-col, then set height to full
Figure4 = code (App.js)
Figure5 = site

This has worked, but the scaling for the navbar has gone all wonky. Ignore the white search bar ill solve that later as its an easy fix.

Fixing: Changing code in Logo.js to fix (shrink-0)
Figure6 = before
Figure7 = after

Fixing: Changing code in Profile.js to fix (shrink-0 mr-[1.5rem])
Figure8 = before
Figure9 = after

All fixed :3
