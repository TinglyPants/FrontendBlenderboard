This project is getting pretty messy, especially with all of the tailwind classes making it hard to read stuff. 

I want to break down large react function components into smaller ones that could be re-used later if needed. Files are
getting too big.

Plan:
Go through each page and slowly break down until nice and readable.
Any repeated code can be extracted to functions in other files.
Add comments if needed, and improve variable naming.
